# Day 24 - Forms Advanced (Signup Form Mock)


## 📌 Topic
Today’s practice was focused on **advanced HTML form elements**: checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown menus, required fields, and placeholders. I built a **signup form mock** that demonstrates how these input types can be combined in a realistic form.

## 📝 What I Practiced
1. **Required attribute (`required`)**
- Ensures the user cannot submit the form without filling important fields (Name, Email, Password, Country, Gender, Terms).


2. **Placeholders**
- Added to input fields like *Name, Email, Password, Bio* for guidance.


3. **Radio Buttons**
- Used for **Gender** selection. Only one option can be chosen at a time.
- Grouped by giving the same `name` attribute.


4. **Checkboxes**
- Used for selecting **Interests** (multiple choices allowed).
- Also used for **Terms & Conditions** agreement.


5. **Dropdown (`<select>`)**
- Implemented for **Country** selection.
- Provides a clean and compact way to pick one value from a list.


6. **Textarea**
- Added for a **Short Bio**, allowing multiline text input.

7. **Fieldset & Legend**
- Grouped related elements (Gender, Interests) for better **form structure and accessibility**
